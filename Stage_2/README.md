# Stage 2 - Architecture of Data Warehousing and Normalization

## Description
Second stage of the project.\
The user learns about Normalization and starts to apply gained knowledge on the project scenario.

## Activities

### Theoretical activities
**2.1. Exploration of Data Warehousing Architecture.**\
2.1.1. Detailed examination of the various components and their interrelationships.\
2.1.2. Case studies of companies implementing different architectural approaches.\
2.1.3. Discussion on scalability, performance, and maintenance considerations.

**2.2. Introduction to Normalization.**\
2.2.1. Explanation of normalization and its objectives.\
2.2.2. Understanding of redundant data and anomalies.\
2.2.3. Examples of non-normalized and normalized data.

**2.3. Detailed explanation and application of each normal form.**\
2.3.1. Practical exercises to normalize sample datasets.\
2.3.2. Discussion on trade-offs and considerations in normalization.

### Practical activities
2.1. Create DW architecture diagram for a small business.\
2.2. Provide examples of normalization types.

## Instructions

### Theoretical activities
The user learns about all topics from Theoretical section based on resources provided on Resources section.

### Practical activities
2.1. Based on project scenario and generated DB for SME the user will generate the DB architecture diagram using [Draw tool](https://app.diagrams.net/). The document should be loaded in PDF format.

2.2. Starting from initial DB and generated architecture diagram the user will normalize data using 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF normalization using [online SQL server](https://sqliteonline.com/#google_vignette). After normalization user will save normalized tables.

2.3. Create PR to submit to the remote repository current stage changes.
